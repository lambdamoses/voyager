    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "[Slide-seq V2](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41587-020-0739-1) is a spatial transcriptomic tool that measures genome-wide expression using DNA-barcoded beads patterned on a slide in an non-regular array. The beads used in the current protocol have a diameter of $10 \\mu m$ and are thus larger than a single cell, but the number of detected transcripts is an order of magnitude higher compared to the previous iteration of the technology.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vignette, we use `Voyager` to analyze a dataset generated using the Slide-Seq V2 technology. The data is described in [Dissecting the treatment-naive ecosystem of human melanoma brain metastasis](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2022.06.007) [@Biermann2022-hl]. The raw counts and cell metadata are publicly available from GEO. We will focus on one of the human melanoma brain metastasis (MBM) samples that are provided in the `SFEData` package as a `SpatialFeatureExperiment`(SFE) object. The SFE object contains raw counts, QC metrics such as number of UMIs and genes detected per barcode, and centroid coordinates for each barcode as a `sf` POINT geometry."

One possible representation is an adjacency matrix.

These entries can be weighted in different ways, including by the length of border shared between two polygons.\n",

Similarly to scRNA-seq data analysis, the goal of normalization is to remove the effects of technical variation and derive a quantity that reflects biological variation. However, several questions arise when considering best practices for spatial data normalization. For example, spatial methods on average detect fewer UMIs than their single-cell counterparts, which may preclude the use normalization techniques such as log transformation as shown [here](<https://doi.org/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab085>). What's more, it is not always evident whether spatial autocorrelation between genes (or QC measures) is an artifact of the technology, and thus, whether normalization methods should preserve the spatial autocorrelation architecture. These questions provide avenues for active research and development, but are currently unresolved. To this end, we log-normalize the data in the cell below and identify variable genes for subsequent analysis."
