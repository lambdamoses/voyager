    "# Normalize data\n",
    "\n",
    "We demonstrate the use of `scater` for normalization below, although we note that it is not necessarily the best approach to normalizing spatial transcriptomics data. The problem of when and how to normalize spatial transcriptomics data is non-trivial because, as the `nCounts` plot in space shows above, spatial autocorrelation is evident. Furthemrore, in Visium, reverse transcription occurs in situ on the spots, but PCR amplification occurs after the cDNA is dissociated from the spots. Artifacts may be subsequently introduced from the amplification step, and these would not be associated with spatial origin. Spatial artifacts may arise from the diffusion of transcripts and tissue permeablization. However, given how the total counts seem to correspond to histological regions, the total counts may have a biological component and hence should not be treated as a technical artifact to be normalized away as in scRNA-seq data normalization methods. In other words, the issue of normalization for spatial transcriptomics data, and Visium in particular, is complex and is currently unsolved.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no one way to normalize non-spatial scRNA-seq data. The commented out code implements the `scran` method [@Lun2016-fb]. To simplify the matter, we only perform `logNormCounts()` in this introductory vignette. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that `scater`'s `logNormCounts()` is quite different from that in Seurat. Let $N$ denote the total UMI count in one Visium spot, $\\bar N$ the average total UMI count in all spots in this dataset, and $x$ denote the UMI count of one gene in the Visium spot of interest. Seurat performs log normalization as $\\mathrm{log}\\left( \\frac{x}{N/10000} + 1 \\right)$, where the natural log is used. In contrast, with default parameters, `scater` uses $\\mathrm{log_2}\\left( \\frac{x}{N/\\bar N} + 1 \\right)$. The pseudocount (default to 1), library size factors (default to $N/\\bar N$), and transform (default to log2) can be changed. Log 2 is used because differences in values can be interpreted as log fold change."

    "Next, we identify highly variable genes (HVGs), which will be used for principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction. Again, there are different ways to identify HVGs, and `scater` does so differently from Seurat. In both frameworks, the log normalized data is used by default. In summary, in Seurat, with default parameters, a Loess curve is fitted to the log transformed data (the log normalized data is log transformed for fitting purposes), and the fitted values are exponentiated as the expected variance for each gene. Then the expected variance and the mean are used to standardize the log normalized gene expression; the standardized values are used to calculate a standardized variance for each gene. The top HVGs are the genes with the largest standardized variance.\n",

The \"technical\" component of the variance is the fitted values from the Loess curve. The \"biological\" component is the difference between the actual variance and the Loess fitted variance. The top HVGs are genes with the largest biological component. See the documentation of `modelGeneVar()`, `fitTrendVar()`, and `getTopHVGs()` for more details.\n",

    "Remark on spatial regions: In geographical space, there is usually no one single way to define spatial regions. For example, influenced by both sociology and geology, LA county can be partitioned into regions such as Eastside, Westside, South Central, San Fernado Valley, San Gabriel Valley, Pomona Valley, Gateway Cities, South Bay, and etc., each containing multiple smaller cities or parts of LA City, each of which can be further divided into many neighborhoods, such as Koreatown, Highland Park, Lincoln Heights, and etc. Definitions of some of these regions are subject to dispute. Meanwhile, LA county can also be partitioned into watersheds of the LA River, San Gabriel River, Ballona Creek, and etc., as well as different rock formations. Which kind of spatial region at which resolution is relevant depends on the question being asked. There are also gray areas in spatial regions. For example, the Whittier Narrows dam intercepts both the San Gabriel River and Rio Hondo (a large tributary of the LA River), so whether the dam area belongs to the watershed of San Gabriel River or LA River is unclear. \n",

    "Similarly, in spatial transcriptomics, while methods identifying spatial regions currently generally only aim to give one result, multiple results at different resolutions depending on the question asked may be relevant. Furthermore, methods for spatial region demarcation to be used for spatial -omics would ideally provide uncertainty assessments for assignment of cells or Visium spots. An existing geospatial method that accounts for such uncertainty is [`geocmeans`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/geocmeans/) [@Zhao2013-gj], which is on CRAN.\n",

    "In both the geographical and histological space, there conflicting views on spatial variation. On the one hand, methods that identify spatially variable genes such as SpatialDE often assume that gene expression vary smoothly and continuously in space. On the other hand, methods identifying spatial regions attempt to identify discrete regions. The continuous variation in features might be why definitions of geographical neighborhoods are often subject to dispute. Some existing methods attempt to harmonize the two views. For example, the spatially variable gene method [`belayer`](https://github.com/raphael-group/belayer) [@Ma2022-ho] takes discrete tissue layers into account.\n",

    "These genes do indeed look spatially variable. However, such spatial variability can simply be due to the histological regions in space, or in other words, spatial distribution of different cell types. There are many methods to identify spatially variable genes, often involving Gaussian process modeling, which are far more complex than Moran's I, such as [`SpatialDE`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/spatialDE.html) [@Svensson2018-sx]. However, such methods usually don't account for the histological regions, except for `C-SIDE` [@Cable2022-ma], which identifies spatially variable genes within cell types. This leads to the question of what is really meant by \"cell type\". It remains to see how spatial methods made specifically for identifying spatially variable genes compare with methods that don't explicitly use spatial information but simply perform differential analysis between cell types which often are in spatially defined histological regions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another consideration in using Moran's I is the extent to which the strength of spatial autocorrelation varies in space. What if a gene exhibits strong spatial autocorrelation in one region, but not in another? Should the different histological regions be analyzed separately in some cases? \n",
    "\n",
    "There are ways to see whether Moran's I is statistically significant, and many other methods to explore spatial autocorrelation. These are discussed in the more advanced [ESDA Visium vignette](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/articles/vig2_visium.html). \n",
