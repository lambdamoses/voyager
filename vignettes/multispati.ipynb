    "# Introduction\n",
    "Due to the large number of genes quantified in single cell and spatial transcriptomics, dimension reduction is part of the standard workflow to analyze such data, to visualize, to help interpreting the data, to distill relevant information and reduce noise, to facilitate downstream analyses such as clustering and pseudotime, to project different samples into a shared latent space for data integration, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first dimension reduction methods we learn about, such as good old principal component analysis (PCA), tSNE, and UMAP, don't use spatial information. With the rise of spatial transcriptomics, some dimension reduction methods that take spatial dependence into account have been written. Some, such as `SpatialPCA` [@Shang2022-wq], `NSF` [@Townes2023-bi], and `MEFISTO` [@Velten2022-gv] use factor analysis or probabilistic PCA which is related to factor analysis, and model the factors as Gaussian processes, with a spatial kernel for the covariance matrix, so the factors have positive spatial autocorrelation and can be used for downstream clustering where the clusters can be more spatially coherent. Some use graph convolution networks on a spatial neighborhood graph to find spatially informed embeddings of the cells, such as `conST` [@Zong2022-tb] and `SpaceFlow` [@Ren2022-xt]. `SpaSRL` [@Zhang2023-mm] finds a low dimension projection of spatial neighborhood augmented data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Spatially informed dimension reduction is actually not new, and dates back to at least 1985, with Wartenberg's crossover of Moran's I and PCA [@Wartenberg1985-re], which was generalized and further developed as MULTISPATI PCA [@Dray2008-cg], implemented in the [`adespatial`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/adespatial/index.html) package on CRAN. In short, while PCA tries to maximize the variance explained by each PC, MULTISPATI maximizes the product of Moran's I and variance explained. Also, while all the eigenvalues from PCA are non-negative, because the covariance matrix is positive semidefinite, MULTISPATI can give negative eigenvalues, which represent negative spatial autocorrelation, which can be present and interesting but is not as common as positive spatial autocorrelation and is often masked by the latter [@Griffith2019-sj]. \n",
    "\n",
    "In single cell -omics conventions, let $X$ denote a gene count matrix whose columns are cells or Visium spots and whose rows are genes, with $n$ columns. Let $W$ denote the row normalized $n\\times n$ adjacency matrix of the spatial neighborhood graph of the cells or Visium spots, which does not have to be symmetric. MULTISPATI diagonalizes a symmetric matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "H = \\frac 1 {2n} X(W^t+W)X^t\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the implementation in `adespatial` is more general and can be used for other multivariate analyses in the [duality diagram](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3265363/) paradigm, such as correspondence analysis; the equation above is simplified just for PCA, without having to introduce the duality diagram here.\n",
    "\n",
    "Voyager 1.2.0 (Bioconductor release) has a much faster implementation of MULTISPATI PCA based on [`RSpectra`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/RSpectra/index.html). See benchmark [here](https://lambdamoses.github.io/thevoyages/posts/2023-03-25-multispati-part-2/).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this vignette, we perform MULTISPATI PCA on the MERFISH mouse liver dataset. See the first vignette using this dataset [here](https://pachterlab.github.io/voyager/articles/vig6_merfish.html).\n",

The lower bound of Moran's I given the spatial neighborhood graph is usually closer to -0.5 than -1, while the upper bound is usually around 1. The bounds given a specific spatial neighborhood graph can be found with `moranBounds()`, but because it double centers the adjacency matrix, hence making it dense, there isn't enough memory to use it for the entire dataset. But we can look at the Moran bounds of a small subset of data, which might be generalizable to the whole dataset given that this tissue appears quite homogeneous in space."

    "What do these clusters mean? Clusters are supposed to be groups of different spots that are more similar within a group, sharing some characteristics. Non-spatial and MULTISPATI PCA use different characteristics for the clustering. Non-spatial PCA finds genes that are good for telling cell types apart, although those genes may happen to be very spatially structured. Non-spatial clustering aims to find these groups only from gene expression, and cells with similar gene expression can be surrounded by cells of other types in histological space. This is just like mapping Art Deco buildings, which are often near Spanish revival and Beaux Art buildings whose styles are quite different and perform different functions, thus not necessarily forming a coherent spatial region. \n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, MULTISPATI's positive components find genes that must characterize spatial regions in addition to distinguishing between different cell types. Which genes are involved in each MULTISPATI component may be as interesting as the clusters. It would be interesting to perform gene set enrichment analysis, or to interpret this as some sort of spatial patterns of spatially variable genes. This is like mapping when the buildings were built, so Art Deco, Spanish revival, Beaux Art popular in the 1920s and 1930s will end up in the same cluster and form a more spatially coherent region, which can be found in DTLA Historical Core and Jewelry District, and Old Pasadena. Hence non-spatial clustering of spatial data isn't necessarily bad. Rather, it tells a different story and reveals different aspects of the data from spatial clustering. \n",
