Notexin was injected into the tibialis anterior muscle of mice to induce injury, and the healing muscle was collected 2, 5, and 7 days post injury for Visium analysis. The dataset in this vignette is from the timepoint at day 2. The vignette starts with a `SpatialFeatureExperiment` (SFE) object.\n",

The H&E image was used for nuclei and myofiber segmentation. A subset of nuclei from randomly selected regions from all 3 timepoints were manually annotated to train a StarDist model to segment the rest of the nuclei, and the myofibers were all manually segmented. The tissue boundary was found by thresholding in OpenCV, and small polygons were removed as they are likely to be debris. Spot polygons were constructed with the spot centroid coordinates and diameter in the Space Ranger output. The `in_tissue` column in `colData` indicates which spot polygons intersect the tissue polygons, and is based on `st_intersects()`.\n",

    "We demonstrate the use of `scran` [@Lun2016-fb] for normalization below, although we note that it is not necessarily the best approach to normalizing spatial transcriptomics data. The problem of when and how to normalize spatial transcriptomics data is non-trivial because, as the `nCounts` plot in space shows above, spatial autocorrelation is evident. Furthemrore, in Visium, reverse transcription occurs in situ on the spots, but PCR amplification occurs after the cDNA is dissociated from the spots. Artifacts may be subsequently introduced from the amplification step, and these would not be associated with spatial origin. Spatial artifacts may arise from the diffusion of transcripts and tissue permeablization. However, given how the total counts seem to correspond to histological regions, the total counts may have a biological component and hence should not be treated as a technical artifact to be normalized away as in scRNA-seq data normalization methods. In other words, the issue of normalization for spatial transcriptomics data, and Visium in particular, is complex and is currently unsolved. "

The `fill` argument is set to `NA` to make the Visium spots look hollow, and the `size` argument controls the thickness of the outlines. The `annot_aes` argument specifies which column in the `annotGeometry` to use to specify the values of an aesthstic, just like `aes` in `ggplot2` (`aes_string` to be precise, since `tidyeval` is not used here).

Row names in `sfe_tissue` are Ensembl IDs in order to avoid ambiguity as sometimes multiple Ensembl IDs have the same gene symbol and some genes have aliases. However, gene symbols are shorter and more human readable than Ensembl IDs, and are better suited to display on plots.  In the `plotSpatialFeature()` function and other functions in `Voyager`, even when the row names are recorded as Ensembl IDs, the `features` argument can take gene symbols with the `swap_rownames` argument indicating a column in `rowData(sfe)` that stores the gene symbols. Gene symbols is then also shown in plots instead of Ensembl IDs. If one gene symbol matches multiple Ensembl IDs in the dataset, then a warning will be given.\n",

However, according to [@Griffith2010-lm], with large sample size (\"preferably at least 100\"), mean and variance of Moran's I of several iid non-normal simulated datasets (including negative binomial, which is commonly used to model gene expression data) don't seem to deviate much from the values expected from normally distributed data. Spatial transcriptomics datasets typically have thousands or more spots or cells, so sample size is most likely large enough. Hence using the analytical test on non-normal data might not be too bad. However, with large sample size, a minuscule difference can create very significant p-values. Here we perform the analytical test for Moran's I:"

    "Getis-Ord Gi\\* is used to find hotspots and coldspots of a feature in space. A hotspot is a cluster of high values in space, and a coldspot is a cluster of low values in space. Getis-Ord Gi\\* is essentially the z-score of the spatially lagged value of the feature at each location $i$ ($\\sum_j w_{ij} x_j$), where $w_{ij}$ is the spatial weight. In the [original publication for Getis-Ord Gi\\* from 1992](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1992.tb00261.x) [@Getis1992-fh], the spatial weight is a distance-based binary weight indicating whether another location is within a certain distance from each location $i$. Getis-Ord Gi excludes the location $i$ itself in the computation of mean and variance of the lagged value, while Gi\\* includes the location $i$ itself. Usually Gi and Gi\\* yield similar results. The mean and variance used in the z-score differ in Gi and Gi\\* and is described in [this paper from 1995](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1538-4632.1995.tb00912.x) [@Ord1995-bv] and derived in [@Getis1992-fh].\n",

    "1. The H&E image can alter perception of the colors of the geometries.\n",
    "2. Only 2D data is supported at present, although in principle, `sf` and `GEOS` support 3D data.\n",
    "3. Spatial neighborhoods only make sense within the same tissue section. Then what to do with multiple tissue sections, from biological replica, and from different conditions? For the mouse brain, different biological replica can be registered to the Allen Common Coordinate Framework (CCF) to be spatially comparable. Indeed, it would be interesting to see the biological variability of healthy wild type gene expression at the same fine scaled region in the brain. However, there is no CCF for tissues without a stereotypical structure, such as adipose and skeletal muscle. We don't have a good solution to spatially compare different tissue sections yet. Perhaps global spatial statistics over the whole section or histological regions within the section can be compared. The problem remains to select the most informative metrics to compare. Perhaps a spatially-informed dimension reduction method, taking not only the gene count matrix, but also the adjacency matrices of the spatial neighborhood graphs (different sections will be different blocks in the matrix) projecting the cells or Visium spots from different sections into a shared low dimensional space can facilitate the comparison. Here batch effect must be corrected, and the dimension reduction should be interpretable, and scalable.\n",
